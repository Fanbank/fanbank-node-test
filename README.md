# Fanbank Node Coding Test

You'll need to clone this repo locally so that you and your future teammates can work through some issues and make improvements to the code together.

Feel free to ask questions or consult any internet resources. The goal is to see how you work and how well we all work together.

## 1. Explore the DB

Use the database credentials provided to explore the structure of the test database. We'll need to whitelist your IP address in order for you to access the database from your local machine.

## 2. Create and Test new route

Create and test a new route that queries the db and returns the businesses and their associated stores.

## 3. Design a new table

Create a diagram based on the existing tables. Extend this diagram to add status flags for each business. Each flag should have a name and status. As a requirement for this table, we may want to query all flags of a certain name.

You can use this or your favorite diagraming tool: https://awwapp.com
